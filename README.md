# Criminal_Records_PDS
A Personal Data Store (PDS) for a criminal records database at a  police station. It takes on a simple menu driven approach, written in C, with the main user interactive interface being the terminal. The user can:

=> CREATE - creates new database </br>
=> OPEN - opens exisiting database and enables interaction </br>
=> STORE - gives options to enter information and store a new record </br>
=> NDX_SEARCH - search based on ID </br>
=> NON_NDX_SEARCH - search based on Criminal Name </br>
=> NDX_DELETE - delete record based on ID </br>
=> OVERWRITE - overwrite record based on ID </br>
=> EXIT - closes open database and exits the application </br>

Note: The files bst.c and bst.h used to build and maintain a binary search tree in the 'search by id' were provided by our professor/TA for the course Database Systems Lab.
